Ethereum Claymore 11.8 No Fee - DevFee Removed

Executable is patched so you don't have to do anything, just start mining.

Once devfee mining is triggered it will mine to your address instead of developers. To make sure everything is working properly check the mining .txt logs for any "eth_submitLogin" where your address doesn't appear. If there are any then restart mining again and it should work properly. Otherwise contact me.
